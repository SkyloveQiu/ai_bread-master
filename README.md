## General Information
- With the resounding growth of humanity over the last few decades, the need for food has increased proportionally. Furthermore, not all food is produced locally anymore. Instead, it is produced abroad, processed in factories, shipped, and eventually lands in a store for a customer to buy. This highly streamlined process has many steps, yet the most familiar one to the people is: The grocery store.
- The goal was to design a robot which automates tedious and time consuming tasks, thus allowing the operator to spend more time taking care of the store itself. Team S.L.I.C.E. has worked the past half year, in name of Ahold Delhaize, to prototype such a robot. The prototype is a first step in the learning process to build a fully working commercial application of this robot. This report will focus on the details and handover of this prototype.\\


## Technologies Used
- python - 3.8.10
- ROS-Core - Noetic
- Tensorflow Lite - 2.7.0
- OpenCV - 4.5.5+
- Ubuntu - 20.04
- PyQT   - 5+ 
- Numpy  - 1.22+
- Pandas - 1.3+ 



## Usage

If you havn't installed ROS, please follow this [instruction](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation)


The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone git@gitlab.tudelft.nl:cor/robotics_minor/robotics_minor_2021/team_1_slice/ai_bread.git
$ cd ai_bread
```

Once `git` has finished downloading:
```sh
$ ./run_main
```
If you see GUI starts up then the application is running.
